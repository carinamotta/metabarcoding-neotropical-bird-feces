## Description
This dataset contains information on bird fecal samples collected in Corumbataí River Basin, São Paulo, Brazil between August 2022 and August 2023. Seeds found in feces samples (n = 64) were morphologically classified as morphotypes and material from the feces was sequenced using metabarcoding.  Assembled reads are provided here (data > processed_data > metabarcoding) but raw sequence data are available in the NCBI BioProject and in the Sequence Read Archive repository under Accession number PRJNA1203590
